# builder

*TEMPORARY REPO WHILE ANY CREDENTIALS OR SENSITIVE INFORMATION IS CUT OUT*

An attempt to centralize the configuration and building of application environments at [eLife](https://elifesciences.org), locally (Vagrant) and remotely (AWS).

# first

Download:

	git clone ssh://git@github.com/elifesciences/builder

Install:

    ./update.sh

Fix any missing pre-requisites and call `./update.sh` again until you see the happy

> all done

message. Updating in the future is as simple as:

    git pull
    ./update.sh

## Next

Your `settings.yaml` file was created automatically and contains options for tweaking the behaviour of `builder`, like the project file it should be using.

By default it points to the `./projects/elife.yaml` project file. This file describes all eLife projects that can be built and their environments.

Project files and the `settings.yaml` file are the **only** two places where configuration is _supported_.

> 'configuration' also exists in `./src/buildercore/config.py` if you're a `builder` dev.

After successfully installing and configuring `builder`, launching a Vagrant instance is a good test that all is working correctly.

### Vagrant

The `Vagrantfile` can build any project, you just need to tell it which one:

    $ vagrant up
    You must select a project:

    1 - journal--vagrant
    2 - api-gateway--vagrant
    3 - ...
    >

... or it can be done with environment variables:

    $ PROJECT=journal vagrant up

### AWS (Amazon Web Services)

The other half of the `builder` project is the ability to create and manage AWS resources. This is controlled with the "bldr" script:

    $ ./bldr -l

Will list all `builder` tasks found in `src/`. These tasks are just Python functions.

A `master-server` instance must exist before project instances can be brought up. [See here](docs/master-server.md) for a walkthrough.

To launch a project backed by a code repository to AWS:

    $ ./bldr deploy

To launch an ad-hoc instance of any project to AWS, use:

    $ ./bldr aws_launch_instance
