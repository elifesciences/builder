The project is expected to package it's state files as a Saltstack formula.

However, a formula is only expected to declare it's dependencies in a `readme`
and offer no example of how it's state files might be used.

Providing a formula and no way to build it independent of the Builder project 
strikes me as being particularly developer-unfriendly.

This example directory within the application's `salt` build directory should
stand as a reference implementation for running the application independent
of the Builder project.
