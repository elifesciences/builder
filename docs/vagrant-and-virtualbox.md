# vagrant and virtualbox

`builder` currently relies on VirtualBox being available to orchestrate VM
builds using Vagrant.  On systems that already have a running hypervisor this
might not be desirable, since only one hypervisor can use virtualization
extensions at a time.  Since the `ubuntu/trusty64` image is only available as a
virtualbox image this makes the situation complicated.

Luckily a vagrant plugin named `vagrant-mutate` exists to work around this.  It
can convert vagrant boxes to different provider formats.  To install it locally
you can run:

```bash
$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-mutate
```

Now you can download the VirtualBox image and convert it to a format that your hypervisor can work with:

```bash
$ vagrant box add ubuntu/trusty64 https://atlas.hashicorp.com/ubuntu/trusty64
$ vagrant mutate --input-provider virtualbox ubuntu/trusty64 <output-format> # libvirt, bhyve, kvm
```

Now you can disable the `virtualbox` check when running update.sh and run vagrant up:

```bash
$ ./update.sh --exclude="virtualbox"

  ...
