# TODO.md

This is just a scratchpad for keeping track of ideas, nice-to-haves, etc.

## done

* delete src/tests/fixtures/additional-projects
    - I think support for different regions and things has been removed
        - it was never really used
* switch to threadbare
    - done
* remove python2 support
    - done
* remove fabric
    - done
## todo

## todo (bucket)

* remove BLDR_ROLE
* switch taskrunner.py print statements to error logs
* emit a description of the job being run before running it
* update_infrastructure, elide 'UserData' in confirmation
  - it's too large and pointless
* change 'call_while' to 'call_until'
    - 'call while ec2 is not running', 'call while file is not present'
        - this negative predicate is awkward
        - 'call until ec2 is running' and 'call until file present' is much better
* build_vars, are these supposed to look like that?
        "ext_node_hostname": "prod--alfred--%s.elifesciences.org",
        "int_node_hostname": "prod--alfred--%s.elife.internal",
* start/stop, I want to be able to start and stop individual nodes
    - ./bldr stop:iiif--prod--2
* ssh, when I specify a node for a non-clustered environment, it should give me a stacktrace
* handle all cases of BUILDER_NON_INTERACTIVE and get_input
* add a changelog and versioning and releases
* revisit tests
    - they take *forever*

* switch *away* from threadbare and fabric to something sane
    - with fewer dependencies
* revisit project configuration
    - config merging is painfully slow
    - 'aws' sections don't make a lot of sense now that resources across terraform and cloudformation are mixed
    - where to store unique per-instance non-templated configuration?
        - is this even the right place?
    - how to model new-instance vs existing-instance changes?
        - for example, new instances should get a ssd, old instances should continue using whatever
    - can project configuration be split from the code altogether?
        - we want to update project config and have it run through tests fast!
    - default resource blocks
        - so an ec2 instance is only present if an ec2 block is included
    - project config speccing
    - rip out caching
        - parsing/merging/validating little yaml/json files should be *quick*
* rename 'trop.py' to 'cloudformation.py'
* rename 'cfngen.py' to 'build_context.py' or something similar
* delete src/tests/fixtures/dummy-project2.yaml
    - looks like the pattern in tests/fixtures/dummy-project.yaml caught on instead
* if skip=ec2 in update_infrastructure, don't bring the nodes into a running state
    - this may actually interfere with IP addresses in the cloudformation template
        - in which case, what depends on those values? surely they would get old/stale quickly ...
* projects, removing caching 
* launch and masterless.launch
    - emit a more useful summary of the stack about to be created. 
        - should each resource have a 'summary'? for example, an ec2 summary could be:
            * test--project.elifesciences.org
            * us-east-1 t3.small instance with 8GB root and 20GB external volumes
            * SSH, HTTP (internal), HTTPS, PostgreSQL, Redis (internal)

        - it currently looks like:
            INFO - masterless - attempting to create masterless stack:
            INFO - masterless - stackname:	elife-libraries--mysqlauth
            INFO - masterless - region:	us-east-1
            INFO - masterless - formula_revisions:	[]
